# ML-Logistic-regression-PCA
This repository demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique.
The project is ideal for those looking to understand how to preprocess data and build efficient classification models in Python. It includes:
>Implementation of PCA for feature reduction.
>Logistic Regression model setup and evaluation.
>Visualization of results and interpretation.
Tech Stack: Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn.



 *I have demonstrated PCA implementation with Logistic Regression on the adult dataset.
 *I found the maximum accuracy with the first 12 features and it is found to be 0.8225.
 *As expected, the number of dimensions required to preserve 90% of variance is found to be 12 components.
 *Finally, I plot the explained variance ratio with number of dimensions.
